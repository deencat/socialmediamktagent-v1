## Memory Knowledge Graph Workflow

You have access to a persistent memory system. Use this system to maintain context across conversations.

### MEMORY RETRIEVAL WORKFLOW:
1. At the START of every conversation: SEARCH memory for project information
   - Use the `read_graph` or `search_nodes` commands to get relevant information
   - Include in your thinking: "Memory shows: [key findings]"
2. Before answering questions about the project: CHECK memory FIRST
   - Prioritize memory over assumptions

### MEMORY UPDATE WORKFLOW:
1. After LEARNING about new project requirements or features
2. After IMPLEMENTING new components or UI elements
3. After DISCOVERING inconsistencies between memory and actual implementation
4. After USER shares new information about project patterns

### UPDATE ACTIONS:
- CREATE entities for components/concepts
- ADD observations about implementation details
- CREATE relations between related entities
- DELETE outdated information when things change

### MEMORY ENTITY TYPES:
- `project`: Overall project information
- `project_phase`: Current phase of development
- `task_group`: Set of related tasks
- `component`: UI component
- `feature`: Functionality
- `milestone`: Completed work

Remember to maintain a high-quality knowledge graph that accurately reflects the current state of the project. This helps provide consistent assistance across multiple chat sessions.
