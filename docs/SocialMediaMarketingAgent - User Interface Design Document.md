User Interface Design Document
Layout Structure
The primary interface is a modular, widget-based dashboard. Users can customize their dashboard by adding, removing, or rearranging widgets according to their preferences and roles (SME Admin, Service Provider, Platform Admin).
A persistent sidebar (on web/desktop) or bottom navigation bar (on mobile) provides quick access to main sections:
•	Dashboard
•	Campaigns/Tasks
•	Rewards
•	Community
•	Settings/Profile
Guided onboarding overlays appear for new users, walking them through key features and setup steps.
Key tasks and campaigns are highlighted within dashboard widgets, ensuring users always see their most important actions.
