## Development Approach

The project follows a prototype-first approach, focusing on building a functional frontend with dummy data before implementing backend functionality. Key aspects of this approach include:

1. **Phased Development:** Breaking down the project into manageable phases with clear deliverables
2. **Component-Based Architecture:** Building reusable UI components that can be assembled into complete features
3. **Comprehensive Testing:** Using Playwright for automated testing of all components and user flows
4. **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the application works well on all device sizes from the start
5. **Documentation-Driven:** Maintaining up-to-date documentation throughout the development process

## Getting Started

To begin working on the project:

1. Read the [Product Management Plan](./Product_Management_Plan.md) to understand the overall approach
2. Follow the [Project Setup Guide](./Project_Setup_Guide.md) to set up your development environment
3. Review the [Component Library Plan](./Component_Library_Plan.md) to understand the UI components
4. Follow the [Development Workflow](./Development_Workflow.md) for day-to-day development

## Contributing

When contributing to the project:

1. Follow the development workflow outlined in the documentation
2. Write tests for all new components and features
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Ensure all code meets the project's quality standards

## Design Mode

The project is currently in **Design Mode**, which means:

- We are developing frontend components only
- Using dummy JSON data to represent backend responses
- Focusing on UI/UX and user flows
- Not implementing actual backend logic
- Maintaining comprehensive tests for all components

This approach allows us to rapidly prototype and iterate on the user experience before investing in backend development.
