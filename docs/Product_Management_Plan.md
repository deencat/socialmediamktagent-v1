# Social Media Marketing Agent - Product Management Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the development approach for the Social Media Marketing Agent platform, focusing on incremental delivery of features in a prototype-first approach. We are currently in **Design Mode**, which means we will:

- Develop frontend components only
- Use dummy JSON data to represent backend responses
- Ensure all UI components are properly linked for navigation
- Make all interactive elements responsive
- Not implement actual backend logic
- Maintain comprehensive Playwright tests for regression testing

## Development Guidelines

### UI Component Development

1. **Component Creation Process:**
   - Create a design mockup or reference
   - Implement the component with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI
   - Add interactivity with React hooks
   - Create dummy data JSON for the component
   - Write Playwright tests

2. **Naming Conventions:**
   - Components: PascalCase (e.g., TaskCard, AnalyticsWidget)
   - Files: kebab-case (e.g., task-card.tsx, analytics-widget.tsx)
   - CSS classes: Follow Tailwind conventions

3. **File Organization:**
   - Group by feature, not by type
   - Keep related components together
   - Use index files for cleaner imports

### Testing Requirements

1. **Test Coverage:**
   - All components must have Playwright tests
   - Tests should verify rendering, interactions, and responsive behavior
   - Include negative test cases where applicable

2. **Test Execution:**
   - Run tests before each PR
   - Fix failing tests before merging
   - Terminate lingering Playwright report server processes before running tests again

3. **Regression Testing:**
   - Maintain a full regression test suite
   - Run the full suite after completing each phase

### Documentation Requirements

1. **Code Documentation:**
   - Add JSDoc comments to all components and functions
   - Document props and state
   - Explain complex logic or algorithms

2. **Product Management Updates:**
   - Update this document after completing each phase
   - Document any deviations from the plan
   - Track progress against milestones

## Development Tools & Technologies

- **Framework:** Next.js with App Router
- **UI Library:** Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI
- **Icons:** Lucide Icons
- **State Management:** React Context + Zustand
- **Testing:** Playwright
- **Notifications:** Sonner Toast
- **Dummy Data:** Static JSON files

## Definition of Done

A feature is considered complete when:

1. The UI component is fully implemented and responsive
2. All interactions work as expected with dummy data
3. Playwright tests are written and passing
4. The code has been reviewed and approved
5. The product management document is updated
6. All identified issues are fixed

## Next Steps

To begin development:

1. Set up the project structure according to Phase 1
2. Create the initial dummy JSON data structure
3. Implement the authentication UI components
4. Begin building the dashboard shell
