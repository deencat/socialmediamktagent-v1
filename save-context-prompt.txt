Before we finish today's session, please:

1. Summarize what we've accomplished in this conversation
2. Note any key decisions, challenges solved, or open questions
3. Create memory entries for any new components/features we've discussed
4. Save the most important context from our discussion

I'm concerned we might be approaching token limits, so please prioritize saving our most important work.
